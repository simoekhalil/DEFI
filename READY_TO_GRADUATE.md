I've built a **complete automated system** that will:

1. ✅ **Create TestCoin2024** (real token on blockchain)
2. ✅ **Execute real trading** to reach graduation threshold  
3. ✅ **Trigger actual graduation** to DEX
4. ✅ **Distribute real creator rewards** (17,777 GALA to you)

## 🚀 **The Complete Process**

### **Investment Required:** ~1,340,985 GALA (~$20,115)

### **Time:** ~30 minutes automated process

## 📋 **Available Commands**

### **🎯 Complete Creation & Graduation**

```
*Creates token + performs all trading + graduates to DEX*

### **🔍 Verify Existing Token**
```bash

*Creates token but doesn't trade to graduation*

## 🎓 **The Graduation Trading Plan**

The test will execute these **real trades** in sequence:

| 4 | 440,985 GALA | **1,640,985.84 GALA** | **100% 🎓** |

**Total Investment:** 1,340,985.84 GALA
